# Welcome! 
 
 This is just a simple passion project I've started while attending a coding bootcamp at **Coding Dojo**. 

 Simply put, I'm a big fan of Pokemon and wanted to make this for other big fans of Pokemon. The functionality isnt groundbreaking or innovative, but its been fun to work on and learn at the same time.

 ## Description - 

 A simple Pokemon randomizer, using the PokeAPI to pull data. Select your starter and your pokemon types, to see which Pokemon you should try and use in your next playthrough!

#### Just Added!

Monotyping - Now select just a single type to recieve a random Pokemon exclusive to that type!

Suggestions - Send us your feedback and bug finds in the footer! 

 #### WIP - 

 ###### Backend Functionality!!

 Coming Soon! You'll be able to register an account that will hold some extra features, such as saving your team, nicknaming your pokemon and selecting your favorite region!

 ###### Random Typing -
 Adding an option to randomize your typings, just to add another layer of randomized chaos for users!

 ###### Media Queries for Tablet and XLarge -
 Add media queries and styling for these two viewports.

###### Credits - 
Adding a link to credit the artist for the images used here!

###### More Styling
Add another info box, with a carousel for images and gifs, maybe even some PokeFacts.
