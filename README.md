# Welcome! 
 
 This is just a simple passion project I've started while attending a coding bootcamp at **Coding Dojo**. 

 Simply put, I'm a big fan of Pokemon and wanted to make this for other big fans of Pokemon. The functionality isnt groundbreaking or innovative, but its been fun to work on and learn at the same time.

 ## Description - 

 A simple Pokemon randomizer, using the PokeAPI to pull data. Select your starter and your pokemon types, to see which Pokemon you should try and use in your next playthrough!


 #### WIP - 

 ###### Monotyping (Just Added! Needs Testing) - 
 Working on adding a way to search for single typing Pokemon only. In the current build, selecting one type is still able to assign you a Pokemon that has that has dual typing or even that type as their secondary.

 ###### Random Typing -
 Adding an option to randomize your typings, just to add another layer of randomized chaos for users!

 ###### Media Queries for Tablet and XLarge -
 Add media queries and styling for these two viewports.

###### Suggestions Box -
Adding a link in the footer to be able to send in requests, suggestions, and/or issues.

###### Credits - 
Adding a link to credit the artist for the images used here!

###### More Styling
Add another info box, with a carousel for images and gifs, maybe even some PokeFacts.
